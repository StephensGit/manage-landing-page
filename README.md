## Overview
For this project, I build out this landing page and got it looking as close to the design as possible. The design is seen in the screenshot above and inside the 'design' folder within this repo. Below contains a link to my final solution using a mobile first workflow. The project is built with semantic HTML5, CSS, CSS variables, Flexbox, and Javascsript(ES6). 


### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up form is submitted if:
  * The input field is empty
  * The email address is not formatted correctly
